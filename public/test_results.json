      "reasoning": "The webpage lists past cabinet nominations that were rejected, withdrawn, or not acted upon, including some from the Trump administration such as Andrew Puzder, Ronny Jackson, and Patrick Shanahan. However, it does not provide information about all of Trump's remaining cabinet picks at any specific point in time, nor does it confirm whether all such picks were ultimately confirmed. The data is historical and incomplete for the purpose of determining if all remaining picks were confirmed, so the question cannot be resolved as YES or NO based on this content alone.",

This data point appears in the 'Economic indicators' table under the '12 months' column for IPCA. Since 4.44% is below 5.50%, and this represents the 12-month inflation figure that would have been measured for December 2025 (the January 2026 publication shows the trailing 12-month period ending in December 2025), the question resolves YES.",
